        <p>Hello ℘uffเe! 🪄 Welcome to PowerPuff's page. As the same goes for PowerPuff girls, we also consist of three girls who literally share the same brain cells 🧠 To be clear, it's only for a fun purpose, so we're not going to commercialise it 🩰This website is made for personal use by the three of us. 
            Since we've been friends since senior high, it's such an impulsive decision to make this website, but let us just let our impulsive thoughts win!
            We'll let you know more interesting information about us 🎀 such as our interests, dream job, and social media account. Like biodata, you can say. It'll also include the most adorable thing, which is our childhood photos. So, let's find out
            <a href="aboutus.html" title="About us" style="color: rgb(255, 119, 142);font-size: medium;">about us more!</a>
